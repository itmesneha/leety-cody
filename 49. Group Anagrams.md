## 49. Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 104
0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

        for s in strs: #for every word in the list
            count = [0] * 26 #a.....z
            # print('count: ', count)

            for c in s: #for every character in the word
                count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
            # print('count:', count)

            res[tuple(count)].append(s) 
            #The error "TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'" occurs when you try to use a    list object as a key in a dictionary or as an element in a set. Lists are mutable and therefore not hashable. Hashable objects are objects with a hash value that does not change over time. Examples of hashable objects include tuples and strings. To solve this error, you can ensure that you only assign a hashable object as a key for a dictionary. For example, you can convert a list to a tuple before using it as a key.
            # print('res:', res)

        return res.values()


    #   res = dict()
    #   print(res)
